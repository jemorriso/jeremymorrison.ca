Hi, I'm Jeremy.

Lately I've been working on freelance sports projects involving web automation, scraping data, creating API clients and building data pipelines. These contracts are a result of this open source library I built that provides free sports betting odds information. It's been really exciting to gain the opportunity to work on these interesting projects and grow my network. If you have a freelance project that you think I'd be a good fit for don't hesitate to get in touch.

More generally, there are 2 pathways that I'm interested in exploring right now -

1. Building modern web apps. I've been having a ton of fun with Next.js, functional programming, JAMStack, GraphQL and the JavaScript ecosystem. I want to be a part of web development as it matures and grows, which means continuing to build solid fundamentals by working on a team as a full-stack developer.

2. A long-term goal of mine is building profitable, self-sustaining sports and finance models. Sports analytics in particular suffers from a lack of good data sources (such as betting information) so it requires a lot of data processing. I'm interested in data engineering roles and anything that helps me get exposure to analytics or machine learning.
